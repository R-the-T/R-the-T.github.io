<h1>About me</h1>
<h3>Hi! I am Rex, a 13-year-old male currently residing in Los Angeles County, California. At school, I learned to code this webpage. Among my hobbies are biking to school and to the beach, boogie-boarding, playing paddle tennis, reading, and playing xbox. My favorite sport is baseball and I am, as of right now, playing for two teams: Easton Arsenal as my travel team; and Santa Monica Pony as rec ball for fun and practice. In addition, I constantly train for baseball. My training regime includes hitting off the tee in my backyard, going to a hitting coach once a week, and working out at home and at CrossFit. I am an avid food lover and I love trying new foods and restaurants. I absolutely love eggs for breakfast, burgers for lunch and pasta for dinner; with all three containing some form of bacon, grilled onions, and tomatoes. I created this webpage in February-March 2015.
